                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                    This automa can be used with the base game or Venus expansion. It is tested with the
                    standalone Concordia Venus game without the team play elements.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Setup</h2>
                    <p>Set up for a normal two player game. It is recommended to reduce the size of the map by
                    omitting one letter group from the A to D city production tiles. For example, if Ionium map in
                    the Venus expansion is chosen, omit those cities marked with the letter ‘B’ from game play.</p>
                    <p>The bot follows the normal rules except the bot does not:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Use the storehouse board</li>
                    <li>Pay/collect money and resources</li>
                    <li>Place/move colonists on the game board</li>
                    <li>Play personality cards to take its action</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    Deal the bot a starting hand of personality cards (8 cards in Venus expansion, omit team play
                    elements) as per normal game rules. Put these aside for end game scoring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The bot starts with 2 colonists. It does not matter land or sea since no bot’s colonists will be
                    placed on the map. Place 15 houses of the bot’s colour to the side. Give the bot the
                    Prefectus Magnus card. Finally, shuffle the automa deck face-down to form the draw deck.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As per normal rules, player gets 5 sestertii and starting hand of personality cards identical to
                    the bot. Player starts with one land colonist and one sea colonist on the capital city. Player’s
                    storehouse is populated with 2 land colonists, 2 sea colonists, one brick, 2 food, one tool, one
                    wine, and one cloth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Player may use Diplomat card to copy the bot’s top face-up automa card.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Turn order</h2>
                    <p>
                        Player goes first. Praefectus Magnus is rotated as per normal rules.
                    <p>
                    <h2>How to use the automa</h2>

                    <p>
                    On the bot’s turn, draw one card from the automa draw deck and
                    execute the action on the top half of the card. The bottom half tells the
                    bot the priority options from left to right to go with the associated action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In this example, when the bot draws an Architect, the bot will attempt to
                    build one house. It will choose an unoccupied city nearest to the capital
                    that has a wine production. If this is not possible, it will choose another
                    unoccupied city nearest to the capital with cloth production and so on.
                    The bot does not need colonist or pay for the cost of building the house.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In this example, when the bot draws a Prefect, the bot will attempt to flip
                    one bonus marker. It will choose an active province that is showing a
                    tool symbol. If this is not possible, it will choose another active province
                    with the wine symbol and so on. The last option is to collect the cash
                    bonus. If this happens, flip all coins symbol to show the goods symbol
                    side. After that, if the bot has possession of the Praefectus Magnus card,
                    pass it to the player. The bot does not collect money and resources.
                    Player’s cities triggered by the Prefect get the production resource as
                    per normal rules.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Actions</h2>
                    <h3>Architect</h3>
                    <p>
                    For this action, pick an unoccupied city closest to the capital that produced the preferred
                    goods as indicated on the option list. The distance between the capital city and the
                    shortlisted city is measured by links which can be made up of all land links, all sea, or
                    combination of both. The city with the shortest distance is the winner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Use the following priority to break tie:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                    City on a province with no existing bot’s houses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    City closest to existing bot’s houses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    City closest to player’s colonists.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Arbitrarily pick any city that share the tie.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    If there are no unoccupied cities that produced the desired goods available, evaluate the
                    next goods in the option list. In the Architect example shown earlier, this would be a cloth
                    production city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If there are no unoccupied cities left on the map, evaluate cities that are occupied with
                    player’s houses. In the same example, this would be a wine production city occupied by
                    player’s house that is closest to the capital.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Prefect</h3>
                    <p>
                    For this action, determine the goods preferred by the bot as indicated on the option list. Use
                    the following priority to break tie:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                    Province with the most number of bot’s houses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Province closest to the capital.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Province with the least number of player’s houses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Arbitrarily pick any province that share the tie.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Senator</h3>
                    <p>For this action, determine the personality preferred by the bot as indicated on the option list.
                    Use left to right to break tie. </p>

                    <h2>End game scoring</h2>
                    <p>End game is triggered as per the normal rules. The Concordia card is awarded as per normal
                    rules. Since the bot’s does not collect money or resources, the Vesta score will always be zero.
                    Beat the bot’s score to win the game.</p>
